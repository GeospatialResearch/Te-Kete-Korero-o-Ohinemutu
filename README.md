Te Kete Kōrero o Ōhinemutu is a map-based web tool built for the people of Ōhinemutu to preserve personal narratives and histories.
The tool allows people to upload scanned documents, photos, videos, audio recordings, and written accounts.
The tool links these narratives with places to help draw connections for current and future generations.

Community members can keep these narratives private to themselves, share them within their immediate whanau, or share wider through various degrees of privacy groups.
Information stored in the tool remains private by default but can be shared with the wider Ōhinemutu community if desired.
It can be used to collate specific scientific data around important features such as ngāwhā, or can be used to store letters with historical and sentimental value to whanau.
We built this tool to preserve mātauranga within the community, and allow the people of Ōhinemutu to collate their own information, for preservation, and conservation, and to enable community planning and projects.

This tool is being adapted to a generic open-source tool that can be used by any other community. Ōhinemutu will keep use of this tool and all their data and images, but the core of the codebase will be shared.
Once this generic release is finalised, documentation for setup will become more easily available.
